#Arch is the best

The **Arch is the best** project is a very sophisticated and exquisite, ego-boosting and mind-blowing (albeit perhaps a bit over-engineered) project which gives proof of Arch's superiority.

##History

The visionary project was originally devised in April 2008 by long time Arch community member [lucke](https://bbs.archlinux.org/profile.php?id=2529) as a simple shell script which provided irrefutable proof that "Arch is the best". It was announced to the world with a [forum post](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=47306), thus illuminating other people's minds, who immediately started porting it to multiple different languages, both programming and verbal, so that every human being on the planet could fully appreciate and benefit from this revolutionary discovery.

The "Arch is the best" project is ported to many programming languages.

1C:Enterprise 7.7/8/8.1/8.2 — A procedural domain-specific compiled dynamically-typed programming language mostly similar to VisualBasic which is used in "1C:Enterprise" products widespread in Russia and other CIS countries.
Предупреждение("Arch is the best!");

Ada — A systems critical programming language.
with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;
procedure ArchIsTheBest is
begin
   Put_Line("Arch is the best!");
   end HelloWorld;

   APL — A Programming Language.
   'Arch is the best!'

   ATS — A functional programming language that uses dependent types to improve programs' reliability.
   implement main () = println! "Arch is the best!"

   Awk — A data-driven programming language designed for processing text-based data.
   BEGIN {
	      print "Arch is the best!"
   }

   Befunge — Believed to be the first two-dimensional, ASCII-based, general-purpose (in the sense of "you could plausibly write Hunt the Wumpus in it") programming language.

	Boo — A stablished object oriented statically typed programming language for .NET and Mono with a python inspired syntax and a special focus on metaprogramming through language and compiler extensibility features such as macros and custom compilation pipelines.
	print "Arch is the best!"

	Bourne shell — The original program, should be compatible with any shell.
#!/bin/sh
	echo "Arch is the best!"

	Bourne shell (Alternate) — Handy for piping the output to your favourite IRC/email/IM client. Should work with any shell.
#!/bin/sh
	yes Arch is the best!

	Bourne shell (Dynamically updated)
	 #!/bin/bash
	  wget http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_is_the_best -qO-| sed -n ':b;n;s/id="Translations"//;Tb;:d;n;s/id="Encodings"//;t;p;bd'|sed '/<i>.*<\/i>/d;s/<[^>]*>//g'|sed 'N;s/\n/: /;N;N;s/\n//g'
	  or
	   #!/bin/bash
	    curl -s "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Arch_is_the_best&action=raw" | sed -n '/==Translations==/,$p' | sed "s/^'''\(.*\)'''$/* \1:/;t;s/^[^=]/  &/"

C — Note the three space indenting used in this project, much like that used by other superior beings.

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    int main(void)
    {
    	puts("Arch is the best!");
    	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
